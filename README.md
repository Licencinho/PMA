A basic dissertation planning app made with flask.

The overall code structure is based on Peter Simeth's template

And an adaptation of University of Warwick's module Digital Development with Python, from Jordan Bruno's repository:

## Running Locally

There's a jupyter notebook file called "run_PMA_flask". You should run the app from there.
